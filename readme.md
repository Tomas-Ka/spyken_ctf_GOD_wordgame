# GOD game
Here is some code that recursively parses some expanding statements, expanding them all into the simplest possible form.

## Running
simply run ``main.py`` to run the project.


## info
The image ``text.jpg`` was parsed with an image to text parser, and the result was cleaned up and made into the ``input.txt`` and then ``input.py`` files
This code is some of the most cursed and not up to standard code I've ever written. But it works, and now I get to never look at it again.
